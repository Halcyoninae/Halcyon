    Halcyon is a robust & extensible music player & audio engine. It supports the most commonly used formats like:
    <ul>
      <li>MP3 (MPEG-Layer III)</li>
      <li>WAV (WAVE)</li>
      <li>OGG (Vorbis, Theora)</li>
      <li>AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format, AIFC)</li>
    </ul>
    and many more...

    It is written in C/C++ for the native backends, especially the audio frameworks and APIs.
    <br>
    Futhermore, the GUI is primarily handled by Java with certain rendering being deferred to native capabilities via JNI (Java Native Interface).
    <br>
    Plugin interfacing can be achieved through either Java or Lua (using LuaJ). All plugins are dynamically loaded at runtime.
